# portfolio
First professional portfolio using html and css 

::INTRO::

This project was a lesson for me. My first go at creating a web/dev project. Two weeks ago I started the UC Berekely Extension Program, Full Stack Boot Camp. My approach to this project was to learn as much of the rudimentary skill needed and implement the parts that stood out to me. I attempted to exceute certain aspects, regardless of my ability to do so with confidence. What I took away from this was that, in order to see my visions revealed, I would need to focus more of the areas that I feel are difficult. These areas are where I realized that I would not possess the tools necassary to create the concept as it was intended. In all, I'm eager to learn and one day be able to render concepts effortlessly from concept to code. Stay tuned !

::ABOUT::

The coding of this portfolio was an assignment given the second week of school. The idea was to build a platform for potential employers to learn a bit about me as a person and assess my skill level, with an eye towards future employment. 

::THE CODE::

I found the placement of certain items to be a challenge. Particularly, struggling with margins for the paragraphs on my "About" page. Again with the placement of text banners on my <img>'s in the "Portfolio" page. The css portion is where I enjoyed coding the most. Just beginning to scrath the surface of what's possible when I gain command of the web/dev tools available to us. Styling <div>'s is the best reward, seeing code turn visual with the click of the refresh button. Even the readme.md was an unexpected jewel.
